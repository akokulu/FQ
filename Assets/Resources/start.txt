Good day sir or madam. I was out for a jaunt in the woods and seem to have misplaced my lamp. Would you be so kind as to retrieve it for me?
Lamp's lost. Go get it.
You look like a capable man. Would you be so good as to retrieve my stolen lamp?
Would you kindly…retrieve my lamp?
Please help! My favorite lamp was stolen by an androgynous man. His hair stood at impossible angles.
You again? What are the chances! I'll pay you well for that lamp.
Fetch!
Lamp!
The fat one took it. My precious.
Hello, I seem to have become separated from my tour group. Would you please retrieve my lamp from them?
You! Oh thank god. You’ll never guess what happened…..It’s in the forest.
They stole my lamp. I think they were carnies.
Last time, I swear.
Do me a solid? It should be in the forest.
I’m as tired as you are, well not quite. But this time it’s in the forest.
A man chooses a boy fetches.
That lamp was all I have. They ran into the forest. If you hurry you can catch them.
My lamp! They took it.
Hurry we need that lamp to save the crystals n' stuff.
Quickly! They ran into to forest.
My lamp some thieves took.
Bring me the lamp. Clear the debt.
If you bring me my lamp I'll give you some pants.
You look like a man good with mundane tasks. How'd you like to get my lamp back?
You've got half a minute to retrieve my lamp!
Killing me won't solve anything so drop that right smartly.
I've already sent someone to retrieve my lamp. But he's gone missing. Go find him, and the lamp.
I was on my way to deliver a platinum chi… lamp. A well-dressed man stole it and left me here.
You need to unite the races and save the galaxy… Or get my lamp.
